# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records key architectural decisions for CareGuard.
Each ADR is a short, immutable document describing a decision, its
context, and its consequences.

## Numbering Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially with a zero-padded three-digit prefix
(e.g., `001`, `002`). This keeps the directory listing sorted and
makes cross-references unambiguous.

| Format | Example | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `NNN-title-with-dashes.md` | `004-pharmacy-pricing-source.md` | ✅ Current standard |

Legacy ADRs that do not follow the numbering convention (e.g.,
`unified-vs-split-server.md`) are assigned a number in the index
below. Their filenames remain unchanged for link stability; the
index entry is the authoritative reference.

## Status Lifecycle

Every ADR has one of the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Proposed** | Under discussion; not yet implemented |
| **Accepted** | Implemented and in effect |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by a newer ADR — see the superseding ADR for current guidance |

### Supersede Process

1. Create a new ADR that documents the replacement decision.
2. In the new ADR's header, add a `Supersedes: NNN` reference.
3. Update the superseded ADR's header to add `Superseded by: NNN`.
4. Update the status column in this index.

## Index

| # | Title | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 001 | [Pharmacy ZIP Code Consolidation](001-pharmacy-zip.md) | Accepted |
| 002 | [PII in Persistence and Audit](002-pii-in-persistence.md) | Accepted |
| 003 | [Unified vs. Split Server](unified-vs-split-server.md) | Accepted |
| 004 | [Pharmacy Pricing Source](004-pharmacy-pricing-source.md) | Accepted |
| 005 | *(vacant — reserved)* | — |
| 006 | [TypeScript Runtime Strategy](006-typescript-runtime.md) | Accepted |

> **Note:** ADR 003 was originally documented as `unified-vs-split-server.md`
> without a numeric prefix. It is canonically referenced as ADR 003 in this
> index. When creating new ADRs, use the zero-padded format.

## Template

Copy the following block when drafting a new ADR:

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: <Short Title>

- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Supersedes:** (optional — number of ADR this replaces)
- **Superseded by:** (optional — number that replaces this ADR)

## Context

What is the issue that motivated this decision? What constraints,
trade-offs, or prior decisions are relevant?

## Decision

What is the change that we are proposing or have agreed to?

## Consequences

Why is this decision a good idea? What are the positive and negative
outcomes? What follow-up work does it enable or block?

## Compliance

How will we verify that the decision is being followed? What
automated checks or manual reviews enforce it?
```
